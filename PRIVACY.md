# Background Pro – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 30 November 2025_

## Overview

Background Pro is a Chrome extension that lets you customize the background
color of websites. This policy explains what data the extension stores and how
it is used.

## Data we store

Background Pro stores the following information locally in your browser using
Chrome’s `chrome.storage` APIs:

- Your selected background colors or themes  
- Per-site settings related to those colors (for example, which color you chose for a specific domain)

This information is used only so the extension can re-apply your chosen
background colors to the sites you visit.

## Data we do **not** collect

Background Pro does **not** collect, transmit, or store:

- Personally identifiable information  
- Your browsing history or full list of URLs you visit  
- Passwords, payment information, or form data  
- Any content from the pages you visit, beyond what is needed to apply CSS styles

The extension does not use analytics, advertising trackers, or third-party SDKs.
All logic runs in your browser.

## Data sharing

Background Pro does **not** sell, rent, or share any data with third parties.
All stored data stays within your own Chrome profile (and may sync between your
devices if you have Chrome sync enabled).

## Permissions

Background Pro requests the following Chrome permissions:

- `storage`: to save your selected colors and per-site settings  
- `activeTab` / host permissions: to apply the chosen background color to the
  current page

These permissions are used solely for the appearance-customization features
described above and are not used to collect personal data.

## Changes to this policy

changes. Any future updates will be published in this document.
